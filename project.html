	<h2> <strong>Government Note!</strong></h2>
	<p>In an effort to create employment opportunities for youths, the Benue State government is collaborating with Troika Tex Digital Communications Ltd., BishBerry Digital Solutions Ltd., Google and Microsoft to conduct a comprehensive tech skill development for youth. <br>

		The training which is scheduled to commence in the coming weeks, is designed to equip the participants with digital skills and international certifications ranging from Digital Marketing and e-Commerce, Advance Data analytics, Data science and analysis, UI/UX (user interface/user experience) programming, frontend and backend programming to mention but a few. <br>
		
		Because we are now heading towards a technology driven economy it is imperative for every Benue youth to be armed for the challenge ahead. <br>
		
		It is in the light of the above, that this administration is introducing the “Benue go digital skills programme” that would train no fewer than 2000 youths in various skills of their choice as stated above. <br>
		
		Call for application starts on Wednesday, 23rd of August 2023 and closes on Wednesday 30th August, 2023. <br>
		
		Every intending participant should visit www.benuetechskills.ng to fill online forms and keep acknowledgment. <br>
		
		Let's come together and foster a generation of skilled professionals who will drive innovation, enhance productivity, and lead Benue State to new heights. I am confident that this intervention will pave the way for a brighter future for all of us. <br>
		
		Together, let's build a thriving digital ecosystem in Benue State!</p>
