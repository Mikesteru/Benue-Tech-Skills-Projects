		I am the last child of my family born with natural ict knowledge born on December 9th 2004.
		Three years ago while i was still in secondary school, i developed an intrest in website design and development. i followed so many youtubers such as dave, freecoded camp, etc to learn website development and i made remarkable progress along the way. Although with many challenges that were along the way i wasn't able continue due to lack of equipment or devices. I'm Very happy about the benue tech skill program which will help awaken my dream.
